# Halo AAC 🗣️

**Halo AAC** is a modern augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) app built in Python.  
It’s designed to sound more *human*, feel *personal*, and move past the 1990s-style AAC apps that haven’t evolved much.

## ✨ Features
- Custom user profiles with favorite words  
- Clean, simple GUI  
- Text-to-speech (TTS) using Windows SAPI  
- Easily expandable word categories  
- Works as a standalone `.exe` (no terminal window)

## 🧩 Setup
You’ll need Python 3.10 or later.

```bash
pip install pywin32 tkinter pyttsx3
python main.py
